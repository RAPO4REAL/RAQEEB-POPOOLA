## 👋 About Me

I am a data analyst with a strong research focus in **biostatistics, survival analysis, causal inference, and multimodal biomedical data science**.  

My work integrates statistical rigour with machine learning to solve complex problems in clinical research, neuroimaging, and population health.

I am particularly interested in:

- 🧠 Multimodal EEG + fMRI integration  
- 📊 Survival and time-to-event modeling  
- 🔬 Causal inference and treatment effect estimation  
- 🧬 Genomics and multi-omics data integration  
- 📈 Risk modeling in health and finance  

I aim to contribute to research at the intersection of statistics, medicine, and computational science.
